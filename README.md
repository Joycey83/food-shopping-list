# food-shopping-list

A mini react project that I made to practice my react fundamental concepts
The project is a simple food shopping list of 10 food items. each food item can be removed individually with a click of a button.

### My practice will include:
+ props
+ useState
+ events
+ spliting components
+ react inline styles
